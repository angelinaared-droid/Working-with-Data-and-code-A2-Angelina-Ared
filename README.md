## General information
This project is a 3-minute dark, melancholic TunePad production inspired by Ethel Cain’s Punish, alongside a self-produced remix that reimagines the emotional intensity of the original. It reflects my personal interest in one of my favourite artists, exploring how coding and sound design can capture a similar mood digitally. 

## Technologies used
This project was created with: 
* Python coding language: Used to write all the functions of loops, rests, lists .
* Tunepad: The software to make the composition on.
* GitHub: Used as the main space to upload my final prototype. 

## Features 
* Custom chord progression built with MIDI note values.
* Layered instruments combining high chords and low bass for contrast.
* Loop-based structure to control rhythm and timing.
* Adjustable note length, velocity, and pitch for variation.
* Shows how basic coding can be used to create structured music. 


## Setup
This project was built using TunePad, a Python-based coding environment for music creation.
No installation is needed, visit this link: 
https://tunepad.com/project/117717 


## Usage 
Open the link into Tunepad:
* In TunePad, press the Play button at the top right corner to hear the composition.
* Follow the  comments for context of MIDI numbers and strucutre of rythmn. 
* Song will end at 260 beats and stop. 

## Project Status 
The project is fully complete and avaliable to access via the link to Tunepad.
